### Canadian-designed open source hardware. For everyone.

## Flexi-Pi

Flexi-Pi is a custom configured LinuxCNC image for use with the [Flexi-HAL](https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/Flexi-HAL) CNC controller and Remora firmware.The Flexi LinuxCNC components are pre-installed along with all of their dependencies, and reference configurations are included to get you started. **You will need to edit these configurations for your specific machine before attempting motion.** The base configuration runs QtDragon_hd as the default supported UI. 

Both the Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi 4 are currently supported. Performance is significantly better with a Pi 5, however the Pi 4 image here performs better than the previous releases. 

**To get started:**
* Download the release for your specific Pi board (Pi 4 or Pi 5)
  https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/Flexi-Pi/releases
* Extract the image archive
* Flash the image to an an 8GB or larger SD card using dd, balenaEtcher, or the tool of your choice. The filesystem will be automatically resized on first boot to fill the entirety of the SD card.
* Install the Pi onto the Flexi-HAL headers and insert the SD card into the Pi.
* Ensure the jumpers are set as shown in the Flexi-HAL Configuration section of this README
* Connect your display, keyboard, etc. to the Pi
* Connect power to the Pi/Flexi-HAL and boot the OS
* Read the contents of the README present on the desktop for instructions specific to the image used. This includes some hints on flashing your Flexi-HAL with the Remora firmware, and starting LinuxCNC.

The default username and password are both `expatria`.

A high-endurance SD card from a reputable manufacturer is recommended. The Sandisk U3 High Endurance cards have performed well in our testing. Select a card with a high read/write speed for the best performance. 


Also pre-installed in this image are the standard Remora-spi and Remora-eth-3.0 components. These are included on an as-is basis, but are updated with each image build. 

### Booting the Pi 5 from an NVMe Drive

If you wish to use an NVMe drive instead of an SD card, you will need to update the boot order in the Pi's EEPROM. You can do this from the Flexi-Pi image running on an SD card. To update the boot order in EEPROM:

* Flash the Flexi-Pi image to an SD card
* Insert the SD card into the Pi and boot
* **Ensure the Pi has a stable source of power for this operation.**
* Open a terminal and enter the command `sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit`
* Change the 'BOOT_ORDER' line to 'BOOT_ORDER=0xf416' to boot from NVMe first, and fall back to SD if not present.
* Add 'PCIE_PROBE=1' to a new line below the 'BOOT_ORDER' line above
* Exit the editor/save the file. The EEPROM will then program automatically.

After editing your EEPROM config should contain:

```
[all]
BOOT_UART=1
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0
BOOT_ORDER=0xf416
PCIE_PROBE=1
```

You can then write the Flexi-Pi image to an NVMe drive using a USB NVMe Dock and your PC, or by downloading the image to the Pi while it is running from the SD card and writing it to your NVMe drive using `dd` or similar. 

We suggest avoiding NVMe hats that install on or otherwise interfere with the GPIO pins. The [Pimoroni NVMe Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/nvme-base) has been tested to work, and mounts to the underside of the Pi which works well with the Pi mounted on the Flexi-HAL.

## Flexi-HAL Configuration
Jumpers need to be in place in the marked locations on the Flexi-HAL for the Pi to communicate with the MCU for firmware flashing:

<img src="https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/remora-flexi-hal/raw/master/Images/Jumper_locations.png" width="500">

These are shipped in place by default from the Expatria shop, but if they have been moved or removed they will need to be replaced. 

To provide sufficient clearance for a cooler on a Pi 5, a 40-pin female header can be used as a riser between the Flexi-HAL and the Pi. 

 
## Getting started with LinuxCNC:

#### For SPI with a Pi connected directly to the Flexi-HAL: 

A git checkout of the Remora-flexi repository is present in the home directory. Update it before getting started to make sure you have the most recent version. Run 'git pull' from within the /home/expatria/remora-flexi-hal directory to update.

Connect 24V power to your Flexi-HAL and a suitable USB-C to your Raspberry Pi. Do not connect anything to the USB-C port on the Flexi-HAL while flashing Remora over the GPIO header. Doing so may prevent the UART bootloader from functioning. 

Flash your Flexi with the current build of Remora by running the following command in a terminal:

`~/flash_flexi ~/remora-flexi-hal/Firmware/FirmwareBin/FLEXIHAL/firmware.bin`

The output should look similar to the following:
```
Entering bootloader...

- System RAM : 30KiB

Resetting board...
Done!
```
If there is a `Failed to init device.` response, there has been an error flashing the firmware which will need to be resolved before proceeding. 

A base PrintNC configuration is provided in the LinuxCNC config directory at `/home/expatria/linuxcnc/configs/flexi-hal`. **Edit the INI with your machine configuration prior to attempting motion.** This base configuration includes QtDragon_hd and vfdmod; vfdmod is configured for the Durapulse GS10 VFD, but the configuration can be changed fairly easily to suit a Modbus VFD. A sample HAL configuration for the HY VFD is included in the reference config, commented out. There are comments in the HAL file to detail what to uncomment/comment out. 

#### For Ethernet via uFlexinet: 

The `remora-eth` component is pre-installed in this image. Also included is a reference configuration for use with the uFlexiNet in the LinuxCNC config directory at `/home/expatria/linuxcnc/configs/uFlexiNet`. You will need upload your configuration file to the FlexiHAL using the `upload_config.py` script that should be in your configuration folder:

`python3 upload_config.py FlexiHAL-config.txt`

To use the RS485 interface on the FlexiHAL via the uFlexiNet you can set up a virtual serial port and use socat to bridge between userspace Modbus components and Remora. If the RS485 component is included in the board config txt, it will listen on port 27183 for UDP packets and forward them to the RS485 port: 

`socat pty, link=/tmp/virtualcom0, raw udp:10.10.10.10:27183 &`

More information on the Ethernet implmentation can be found in the README in the repository: https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/Remora-STM32F4xx-W5500

#### Autostarting LinuxCNC on boot:

If you'd like to autostart LinuxCNC on boot after configuring your machine, add `linuxcnc -l` to 'Application Autostart' in the 'Session and Startup' menu to automatically load the configuration you last selected in the LinuxCNC selection window.
